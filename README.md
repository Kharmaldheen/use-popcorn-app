# About the usePopcorn app

The usePopcorn app is a movie app where a user can searc for any movie, rate the movie add the movie to a watchlist, and delete the movie from the watched list. The project was built to practise important react concept such as useEffect and its cleanup function, useRef, useState, component composition and custom hookes. I learned a lot of stuff while building this app.

Happy checking!!
